# HTTP Middleware
For every bus system a middleware exists and one Middleware to rule them all. If you use JSON or XML in the request body
for your message data, you have to convert this data to an array before you can call the middleware.

> Note: The middleware uses an array for the message data

## CommandMiddleware
The `CommandMiddleware` dispatches the message data to the command bus system. This middleware needs an request attribute 
(`$request->getAttribute(\Prooph\HttpMiddleware\CommandMiddleware::NAME_ATTRIBUTE)`) called `prooph_command_name`. 
This name is used for the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\MessageFactory` to create the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\Message` 
object. The data for the command is extracted from the body of the request (`$request->getParsedBody()`) and must be an 
array.

## QueryMiddleware
The `QueryMiddleware` dispatches the message data to the query bus system. This middleware needs an request attribute 
(`$request->getAttribute(\Prooph\HttpMiddleware\QueryMiddleware::NAME_ATTRIBUTE)`) called `prooph_query_name`. 
This name is used for the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\MessageFactory` to create the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\Message` 
object. The data for the query is extracted from query params of the request (`$request->getQueryParams()`) and must be an 
array.

There is a special behaviour implemented. If you send a *POST* HTTP request, then the parsed body data (`$request->getParsedBody()`) 
will be added to the payload under the key `data`. `data` is a reserved key if you use a *POST* HTTP request. However, it's
not recommended to use a *POST* HTTP request here. Use it only if you know what you do.

## EventMiddleware
The `EventMiddleware` dispatches the message data to the event bus system. This middleware needs an request attribute 
(`$request->getAttribute(\Prooph\HttpMiddleware\EventMiddleware::NAME_ATTRIBUTE)`) called `prooph_event_name`. 
This name is used for the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\MessageFactory` to create the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\Message` 
object. The data for the event is extracted from the body of the request (`$request->getParsedBody()`) and must be an 
array.

*Note:*

The `EventMiddleware` is commonly used for external event messages. An event comes from your domain, which was caused
by a command. It makes no sense to use this middleware in your project, if you only use a command bus with event sourcing. 
In  this case you will use the [event store bus bridge)](https://github.com/prooph/event-store-bus-bridge "Marry CQRS with Event Sourcing").

## MessageMiddleware
The `MessageMiddleware` dispatches the message data to the suitable bus system depending on message type. The data 
for the message is extracted from the body of the request (`$request->getParsedBody()`) and must be an array. The 
`message_name` is extracted from the parsed body data. This name is used for the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\MessageFactory` 
to create the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\Message` object. Your specific message data must be located under the `payload` 
key. The value of `$request->getParsedBody()` is an array like this:

```
[
    'message_name' => 'command:register-user',
    'payload' => [
        'name' => 'prooph'
    ],
    'metadata' => []
    // other keys like uuid
]
```

**Important:** The provided message factory must handle all 3 types (command, query, event) of messages depending on 
provided message name. It's recommended to use an prefix or something else in the message name to determine the correct
message type.
